  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This website is run by the Catalyst Notify team at CAST. It is designed to be used by as many people as possible. You should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The text should be clear and simple to understand.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How accessible this website is</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    <li>one page links to a PDF document that is not fully accessible</li>

    Catalyst is committed to making its website accessible
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Non-accessible content</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Screen reader users may find the process of moving templates and folders confusing. This fails <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value">WCAG 2.1 success criteria 4.1.2 (Name, role, value)</a>.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">We made some changes that will be tested by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) at the end of January. If possible, we plan to fix this by March 2021.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">
    PDFs and other documents
  </h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    One page links to a PDF document that is not fully accessible. This is not a fail under any WCAG 2.1 success criterion.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We provide a written description of the information in the PDF on an HTML page as an accessible alternative.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">
    Emails
  </h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The JAWS and NVDA screen readers announce extra spaces in emails when viewed in Microsoft Outlook.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We’ll continue to investigate the cause of this issue and, if possible, fix it by March 2021.
  </p>

    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested on 15 July 2020. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11th March 2019. Both tests were carried out by DAC.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This statement was prepared on 23 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 14 January 2021.
